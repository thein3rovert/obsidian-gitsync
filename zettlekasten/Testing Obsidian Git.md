Hello Obsidian..haha 

New update

So i had issues with my mouse then i had issue with obs..haha.

Now i will try the git-sync app on my iphone and seee if its works.

Testing mobile…

Today, I had the chance to try out a cross platform git client introduced to me by @..

It’s Essentially a mobile git client for syncing a repository between remote and local directory.
I recently cut off my subscription for obsidian sync and I’m happy this will be a replacement for that.

It let you sync your obsidian note to you mobile devices.. it’s definitely worth the try.
